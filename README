Chrome extension to keep track of information during a game of dominion on
dominion.isotropic.org.

The extension keeps track of:
- # of cards each player has
- # of points each player has

These are displayed in the bottom beside the chat box.

Known issues:
- possession is not supported
- vineyard, duke, and gardens are not implemented
- not tested in > 2 players (but should work)
- doesn't always realize a new game has started (reload page to fix)
- probably lots of other stuff :)
