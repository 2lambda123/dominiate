Chrome extension to keep track of information during a game of dominion on
dominion.isotropic.org.

The extension keeps track of:
- # of cards each player has
- # of points each player has

These are displayed in the bottom beside the chat box.

Known issues:
- players with spaces in their name are not supported
- possession is not supported
- vineyard, duke, and gardens are not implemented
- doesn't always realize a new game has started (reload page to fix)
- code is a horrible hack :P
- probably lots of other stuff :)
