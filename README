Chrome extension to keep track of information during a game of dominion on
dominion.isotropic.org.

The extension keeps track of:
- # of cards each player has
- # of points each player has

These are displayed in the bottom beside the chat box.

Known issues:
- possession is not supported
- vineyard, and duke are not yet implemented
- code is a horrible hack :P
- probably lots of other stuff :)

Future direction:
Once this has stabilized to have fewer known issues, I'd like to turn it into
something like an IRC bot. It can announce itself and the command to query for
status at the beginning of the game. Then both players can take advantage of
it. Thanks rrenaud for the idea.
