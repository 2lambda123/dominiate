Cards that still need to be coded (34)
======================================

Easy cards
----------
These cards can probably be defined in terms of existing decisions.

Cartographer (just use discardValue and chooseOrderOnDeck)
Develop (easy because Remake and chooseOrderOnDeck are already defined)
Haggler (just needs a buyInPlayEffect)
Jack of All Trades
Oasis
Oracle
Pearl Diver
Spy
Transmute

Not-so-easy cards
-----------------
These generally require some decision-making code that doesn't exist yet.

Apprentice
Bishop
Contraband
Duchess (involves a gainEffect on Duchy)
Embargo
Envoy
Forge
Governor
Hamlet
Inn
Mining Village
Minion
Native Village
Salvager
Scrying Pool
Spice Merchant (trash-for-benefit meets chooseBenefit)
Stables
Swindler
Trader (Reaction is moderately easy. Maybe it's best to consider this just a trasher, not a trash-for-benefit, because gaining gobs of Silver is rarely that much of a benefit.)

Difficult cards
---------------
In estimated order of difficulty:

Scheme (adds a new sub-phase to cleanup)
Secret Chamber (avoid infinite loops)
Young Witch (requires a well-defined Bane card)
Stash (requires a decision mid-shuffle)
Black Market (requires a more coherent definition of the Supply)
Possession (will require entirely new kinds of AI decisions)
