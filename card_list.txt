Cards that still need to be coded (28)
======================================

Easy cards
----------
These cards can probably be defined in terms of existing decisions.

Cartographer (just use discardValue and chooseOrderOnDeck)
Haggler (just needs a buyInPlayEffect)
Oracle
Pearl Diver
Transmute

Not-so-easy cards
-----------------
These generally require some decision-making code that doesn't exist yet.

Apprentice
Bishop
Contraband
Develop (the hard part is making the list of choices)
Embargo
Forge
Ghost Ship
Governor
Hamlet
Inn
Mining Village
Minion
Native Village
Salvager
Scrying Pool
Spice Merchant (trash-for-benefit meets chooseBenefit)
Swindler

Difficult cards
---------------
In estimated order of difficulty:

Scheme (adds a new sub-phase to cleanup)
Secret Chamber (avoid infinite loops)
Young Witch (requires a well-defined Bane card)
Stash (requires a decision mid-shuffle)
Black Market (requires a more coherent definition of the Supply)
Possession (will require entirely new kinds of AI decisions)
