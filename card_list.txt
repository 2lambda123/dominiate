Cards that still need to be coded (20)
======================================

Easy cards
----------
These cards can probably be defined in terms of existing decisions.

Oracle
Transmute

Not-so-easy cards
-----------------
These generally require some decision-making code that doesn't exist yet.

Apprentice
Bishop
Contraband
Develop (the hard part is making the list of choices)
Embargo
Forge
Governor
Inn
Mining Village
Minion
Native Village
Salvager
Swindler (probably needs a list of cards that are likely to suck, plus different strategies for the early/late game)

Difficult cards
---------------
In estimated order of difficulty:

Scheme (adds a new sub-phase to cleanup)
Secret Chamber (avoid infinite loops)
Black Market (requires a new setup step)
Stash (requires a decision mid-shuffle)
Possession (will require entirely new kinds of AI decisions)
