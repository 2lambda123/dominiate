Cards that still need to be coded (40)
======================================

Hinterlands
-----------
Keeping these separate because we may have simply not thought about them enough.

Cartographer (easy, just use discardValue and chooseOrderOnDeck)
Develop (pretty easy because Remake and chooseOrderOnDeck are already defined)
Duchess (moderate and weird: we should basically define it as a gainEffect on Duchy)
Embassy (easy)
Haggler (easy, just needs a buyInPlayEffect)
Highway (easy, increment @bridges)
Inn (moderate to hard; new complex decision)
Jack of All Trades (moderately easy)
Margrave (easy)
Noble Brigand (easy, borrow from Thief)
Oasis (easy)
Oracle (moderate; same code as Spy)
Scheme (moderate and awkward)
Spice Merchant (moderate to hard: trash-for-benefit meets chooseBenefit)
Stables (moderate; new decision)
Trader (Reaction is moderately easy. Maybe it's best to consider this just a trasher, not a trash-for-benefit, because gaining gobs of Silver is rarely that much of a benefit.)

Easy cards
----------
These cards can probably be defined in terms of existing decisions.

Pearl Diver
Spy
Transmute

Not-so-easy cards
-----------------
These generally require some decision-making code that doesn't exist yet.

Apprentice
Bishop
Contraband
Embargo
Envoy
Forge
Governor
Hamlet
Mining Village
Minion
Native Village
Salvager
Scrying Pool
Swindler

Difficult cards
---------------
In estimated order of difficulty:

King's Court
Throne Room
Secret Chamber (avoid infinite loops)
Young Witch (requires a well-defined Bane card)
Stash (requires a decision mid-shuffle)
Black Market (requires a more coherent definition of the Supply)
Possession (will require entirely new kinds of AI decisions)
