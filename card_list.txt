Cards that still need to be coded (26)
======================================

Easy cards

The code to make these cards work already mostly exists.

Feast
Golem
Pearl Diver
Rabble

Not-so-easy cards
-----------------
These generally require some decision-making code that doesn't exist yet.

Apprentice
Bishop
Contraband
Embargo
Envoy
Forge
Hamlet
Mining Village
Minion
Native Village
Salvager
Scrying Pool
Spy
Swindler
Transmute

Difficult cards
---------------
In estimated order of difficulty:

King's Court
Throne Room
Secret Chamber (avoid infinite loops)
Young Witch (requires a well-defined Bane card)
Stash (requires a decision mid-shuffle)
Black Market (requires a more coherent definition of the Supply)
Navigator (probably requires a function for evaluating a hand)
Possession (will require entirely new kinds of AI decisions)
